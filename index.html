Seventeen-point-two billion eyes that can look; 17.2 billion that can watch; 17.2 billion that can read, analyze, and process. But of those 17.2 billion, none but a select few will truly <b>see</b>. Only a few will enter this world with the gift of vision.</p>
				<p>But who are these mythic individuals, those with the gift of sight? What do they do? And where on Earth do they hide?</p>
				<p>This is the story of one house—eclectic, enigmatic, and eternal—where those with the gift of sight have gathered over the years, sharing their visions with the world in a farrago of leather and bamboo; of reds and greens; of dreams and fantasies. <b>This is the story of the House of Gucci.</b></p>

Born, raised and educated in Rome, creative director Alessandro Michele took hold of the wheel in January 2015, launching the house into a new era of unequivocal glory. With an eye for both the retro and the modern, Michele’s eccentric, maximalist taste turned the collective head of the industry and re-established Gucci as one of the most sought-after brands of the time.</p></div>
